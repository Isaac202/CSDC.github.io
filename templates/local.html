						<p>
						Located in Northeast Brazil, with the third-largest urban population of Brazil (about 3 million people) and the eighth in Latin America, Salvador is the capital of the state of Bahia and was the first capital of Brazil. Its metropolitan area has the second largest GDP in the North-Northeast Brazil.
						<br>
						<br>
						One of Salvador’s most well-known parties is Carnival, which bring tourists from all around the world and is considered by many as the biggest street party in the world. Among the main touristic points, the historical center—also known as Pelourinho—stands out for its architecture, specially its baroque churches, museums and various artistic and cultural demonstrations. There you can find crafts, music, Capoeira, and social projects. While visiting Pelourinho is hard to avoid tasting Bahia’s most traditional dishes such as caruru, vatapá, acarajé, bobó-de-camarão, moqueca baiana, and abará.
						<br>
						<br>	
						Salvador’s coast is one of the biggest in Brazil and covers a large number of paradisiac beaches such as Praia do Forte and Praia do Flamengo, being Morro do São Paulo a couple of hours away. Another attraction in Salvador is the beautiful sunset at Barra lighthouse. Salvador, you can feel the difference!
